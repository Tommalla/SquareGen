SquareGen
======

The aim of this project is to write a simple AI that would generate strings of fixed length (called 'n') over binary alphabet ({0, 1}) that would contain the highest
amount of distinct squares possible. A square is such a substring *z* that the whole string contains at least one occurence of *zz* .
